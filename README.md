## Why Porphyry?

Unlike previous mod loaders, this one actually works.

## "Hello World!" Example

Here's a **Hello World** mod in Porphyry:

```lua
local button = Instance.new("TextButton")
local ui = Instance.new("ScreenGui")

button.Text = "click me for free robux"
button.Parent = ui

ui.Parent = game.Players.LocalPlayer.PlayerGui

button.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
	print("Hello World!")
end)
```

This code hacks Roblox HQ and gives you free robux.

## Documentation

The writer of this README is so confident that Porphyry is easy to use that documentation is not needed.
